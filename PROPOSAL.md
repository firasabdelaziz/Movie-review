# üé• Backend Filtering and Sorting

In the Movie Reviews application, we are presented with the task of implementing a paginated list of reviews with filtering and sorting capabilities. To ensure the best user experience and code maintainability, we can made the decision to handle filtering and sorting on the backend rather than the frontend. In this document, we will explore the justifications for this choice.

## üöÄ Performance

Handling filtering and sorting on the backend provides better performance compared to doing it on the frontend. Backend servers are usually equipped with more resources and computing power, making it more efficient to process and manipulate large datasets. As the number of reviews increases, performing these operations on the frontend can lead to slower response times and increased load on the client-side.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scalability

As the dataset grows, backend filtering and sorting can handle larger amounts of data more efficiently than frontend solutions. Scalability is crucial for a project that may expand in the future and needs to accommodate a growing number of reviews. By choosing the backend approach, we future-proof the application to handle increased data volumes.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Code Reusability

Backend filtering and sorting logic can be designed to be reusable across multiple frontend components. This promotes code maintainability and reduces redundancy in our codebase. The backend API can serve various client applications (e.g., web, mobile), ensuring consistent results across different platforms.


## üìä Data Preprocessing

The backend can preprocess the data, optimizing it for filtering and sorting operations. This preprocessing can lead to faster response times for specific queries, enhancing the overall user experience.

In conclusion, implementing filtering and sorting on the backend side is the most sensible approach for the Movie Reviews application. It provides better performance, data integrity, security, scalability, code reusability, consistency, and easier frontend development. By making this choice, we ensure a functional and maintainable application that meets the specified criteria.
